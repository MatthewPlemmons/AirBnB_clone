# Holberton B&B

This is a project to create a simple AirBnB clone. It will eventually expand to
include a front-end website, a database, and an API allowing them to communicate.
To start, though, we've put together a command interpreter for the project.

### hbnb Console

The hbnb console is a command interpreter for managing data and objects specific
 to the project.

### Usage

Getting the hbnb console up and running is simple. Just run the console from
 your terminal to begin.

```$ ./console.py
(hbnb)
```
The (hbnb) prompt indicates the console is ready for commands! For a list of
available commands, enter the help command. Currently implemended commands are:

* `create`
* `show`
* `update`
* `show`
* `all`
* `destroy`
* `quit` or `exit`
